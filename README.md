The zo_screenshot plugin helps restrict screenshots and screen recording in Flutter apps, enhancing security and privacy by preventing unauthorized screen captures.

## Getting started

First, add zo_screenshot as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zo_screenshot : ^[version]
```

## Import the package

```dart
import 'package:zo_screenshot/zo_screenshot.dart';
```

# Usage

### Disabling ScreenShot

```dart
final _zoScreenshotPlugin = ZoScreenshot();
_zoScreenshotPlugin.disableScreenShot();
```

**Enabling Screenshot**

```dart
final _zoScreenshotPlugin = ZoScreenshot();
_zoScreenshotPlugin.enableScreenshot();
```

**Listen To Screenshot Event**

```dart
final _zoScreenshotPlugin = ZoScreenshot();

_zoScreenshotPlugin.startScreenshotListner(
  screenShotcallback: () {
    print("Screenshot taken");
  },
);
```

### Secure Specific Routes

Financial apps like Google Pay (GPay) prevent sensitive screens from being recorded or captured. You can implement similar security measures in your app by blocking screenshots and screen recordings on specific routes. The approach depends on your navigation styleâ€”whether you're using named routes or class-based navigation.

`For Named Route`

```dart
return MaterialApp(
  navigatorObservers: [
    ZoNavigatorObserver(
      navigationStyle: NavigationStyle.namedRoute,
      secureNamedRouteList: ["/secureRoute"],
    ),
  ],
  routes: {
    "/secureRoute": (context) => const SecureRoute(),
    "/nonSecureRoute": (context) => NonSecure(),
  },
  home: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      centerTitle: true,
      title: const Text('Zo Screenshot Example'),
    ),
    body: Example(),
  ),
);
```

`For Class Route`

```dart
return MaterialApp(
  navigatorObservers: [
    ZoNavigatorObserver(
      navigationStyle: NavigationStyle.classRoute,
      secureClassRouteList: [SecureRoute],
    ),
  ],
  home: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      centerTitle: true,
      title: const Text('Zo Screenshot Example'),
    ),
    body: Example(),
  ),
);
```

`Show Preview While App is in Background`

![BackgroundPreview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8614c5dc-5cab-4ca4-8cd4-1f3b060e5b08)

Wrap with ZoScreenShotWrapper

```dart
ZoScreenShotWrapper(
  disableScreenShot: true,
  backgroundPreviewWidget: Container(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      gradient: LinearGradient(
        begin: Alignment.topCenter,
        end: Alignment.bottomCenter,
        colors:[Colors.grey[300]!, Colors.grey],
      ),
    ),
    width: double.infinity,
    height: double.infinity,
    child: Center(
    child: Icon(Icons.lock, size: 50, color: Colors.white),
    ),
  ),
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('Plugin example app'),
    ),
    body: Example(),
  ),
);

```
